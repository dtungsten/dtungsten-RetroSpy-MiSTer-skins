## FAQs

### What is RetroSpy?

A fork of NintendoSpy, RetroSpy is designed to present controller inputs from a console or computer in a display window. This allows you to show your controller inputs for things like speedrunning, game tutorials, and more. You can also convert controller presses into keystrokes to control programs on your computer such as LiveSplit and OBS.

### My Buttons Are Wrong!

Sometimes, a controller might be mapped differently compared to what the skin has mapped.  

In order to fix this, follow these steps:

| Step | Example |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| 1. Open RetroSpy | |
| 2. Run the "helper" skin for the category/type you are using (generic, MiSTer, etc) | ![Helper Choice](docs/example-helper-choice.png) |
| 3. When you press buttons, you will see what value that buttons correlates to | ![Helper Skin](docs/example-helper-skin.png) ||
| 4. Open the skin folder of the skin you want to fix | |
| 5. Open the skin.xml file in a text editor | |
| 6. Change the respective button name to match the output you are seeing in the helper | ![Update Skin.xml](docs/example-update-skin.png) |
| 7. Save the file | |
| 8. Restart RetroSpy | |
